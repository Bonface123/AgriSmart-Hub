# AgriSmart-Hub
AgriSmart Hub is a web-based platform designed to digitize and streamline the distribution of farm inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, and pesticides. The system enables farmers to register, place orders online, and receive SMS updates on order status, eliminating the need for long-distance travel and reducing reliance on middlemen.
